 * for example would be that given a currentVersion of 1 and target of 3
 * MigrationV2ToV3 would be called by the {@link UpgradeHelper} it would defer
 * to MigrationV1ToV2 who would apply the required changes before returning to
 * allow MigrationV2ToV3 to apply it's changes completing the migration process.
